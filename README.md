# Counting-islands.-Classical-Algorithms
This implementation uses DFS to explore the connected components of the matrix, marking each cell as visited once it has been processed. The number of islands is incremented each time a new unvisited island cell is found. 
The algorithm has a time complexity of O(M*N), which is the best we can do for this problem. Since we need to visit every cell in the matrix at least once, we can't achieve a faster algorithm than this. This is because, in the worst-case scenario, you have to visit every single cell in the matrix to determine the number of islands.
